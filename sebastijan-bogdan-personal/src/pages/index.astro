    <p class="section-intro">
      Full Stack Software Engineer focused on scalable backend architecture and well-structured frontend systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I design and build full stack applications that prioritize clarity, reliability, and long-term maintainability.
      My work spans backend services, APIs, and frontend interfaces, with an emphasis on strong boundaries,
      predictable behavior, and clean integration between layers. I optimize for change over time — not just
      for delivery speed on day one.

    <p><strong>Reliability &amp; Maintainability</strong><br />
