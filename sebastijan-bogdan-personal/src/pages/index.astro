    <p class="section-intro">
      Software Engineer focused on scalable backend systems and long-term maintainable architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      I design and implement backend systems that prioritize clarity, reliability, and long-term adaptability.
      My work centers on well-defined service boundaries, predictable system behavior, and pragmatic engineering discipline.
      I value solutions that remain understandable and resilient as teams and requirements evolve.
