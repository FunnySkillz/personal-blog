      Full Stack Engineer focused on scalable systems and structural clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I design and build full stack systems that prioritize clarity, reliability, and long-term structure. My work spans backend services, APIs, and frontend interfaces, with an emphasis on strong boundaries and predictable behavior. I optimize for change over time — not just delivery speed on day one.

    <p><strong>Reliability &amp; Maintainability</strong><br />
