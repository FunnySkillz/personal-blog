    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>I build systems that need to be correct.</p>

    <p>
      Most of my work is in regulated environments, including public-sector and
      financial applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work across backend and frontend layers. I care about structure, clear
      boundaries, and predictable behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      I lead a team of six developers. My focus is architectural direction and
      disciplined execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed formal training in System Requirements Engineering. Precision
      early prevents complexity later.
